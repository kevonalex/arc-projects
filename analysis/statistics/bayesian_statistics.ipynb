    "Imagine the probability of all outcomes as a multiverse, and each point within the Venn diagram is a universe with a potential outcome. If we want to find the probability of one event, given we know that another event has happened, we can use this model to visualise the result. A core fundamental concept in probability (the very definition of probability) is that the likelihood of an event happening. The probability of an event occuring can be determined by calculating the number of situations where a specific event occurs divided by all of the possible situations. We can extend this to match our example by considering all of the universes within which two events occur, A and B, if we want to know the conditional probability of A happening, we need to calculate the ratio of all of the unverses in which A and B occur, (A n B), and divide this by the number of events where only B occurs.
