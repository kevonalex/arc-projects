# arc-projects
Arc Studios' projects, demonstrations, etc.

This repository will house all of the projects and experimentation for Arc Studios.

The main subject areas these projects will explore span four broad topics:

1. Software Development
2. Data Analysis
3. Computational Modelling
4. Research

The fields of knowledge this repository aims to cover are natural sciences, finance, and cybersecurity. These are all fields where highly performant software is highly valued. These demonstrations aim to simply the journey towards understanding how optimisations happen, from first principles.
