    "\n",
    "## 3. Advanced Level: Machine Learning for Price Prediction & Portfolio Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "### Skills:\n",
    "- Machine learning (e.g., decision trees, random forests, LSTMs)\n",
    "- Feature engineering and selection\n",
    "- Portfolio optimization\n",
    "- Advanced backtesting and performance evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks:\n",
    "1. **Predictive Model for Stock Prices**:\n",
    "   - Use machine learning algorithms like decision trees, random forests, or deep learning (e.g., LSTM neural networks) to predict future stock prices based on historical data and technical indicators.\n",
    "   - Perform feature engineering (e.g., adding lagged returns, technical indicators like RSI, MACD) to improve predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Portfolio Optimization**:\n",
    "   - Build an optimization model using techniques like Markowitz Efficient Frontier or mean-variance optimization to create a portfolio of stocks that maximizes returns for a given risk level.\n",
    "   - Use historical data to simulate how the portfolio would have performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Advanced Backtesting**:\n",
    "   - Develop a comprehensive backtesting system that accounts for transaction costs, slippage, and other real-world factors.\n",
    "   - Evaluate trading strategies with metrics like the Calmar ratio, maximum drawdown, and alpha/beta.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deliverables:\n",
    "- A script for stock price prediction using machine learning.\n",
    "- A portfolio optimization model with visualization of the efficient frontier.\n",
    "- A comprehensive backtesting framework with detailed performance metrics.\n"
