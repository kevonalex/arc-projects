    "\n",
    "## 2. Intermediate Level: Trading Strategies and Backtesting\n",
    "\n",
    "### Skills:\n",
    "- Time series analysis\n",
    "- Basic machine learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression)\n",
    "- Backtesting trading strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks:\n",
    "1. **Moving Average Crossover Strategy**:\n",
    "   - Implement a simple trading strategy using two moving averages (short-term and long-term).\n",
    "   - **Buy** when the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average, and **sell** when it crosses below.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Backtesting**:\n",
    "   - Implement a backtest to simulate the strategy on historical data.\n",
    "   - Calculate performance metrics such as total return, Sharpe ratio, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Regression-based Model**:\n",
    "   - Use linear regression to model the relationship between stock prices and potential factors like volume or past returns.\n",
    "   - Predict the next day's closing price and compare the prediction with the actual value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deliverables:\n",
    "- A script for the moving average crossover strategy and backtesting.\n",
    "- A Jupyter notebook with the regression model and performance analysis.\n"
