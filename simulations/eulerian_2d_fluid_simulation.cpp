// COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS
// ARC PROJECTS - SIMULATION PROJECT 05-07-2025
// This project is intended to demonstrate the basics with regards to computational fluid dynamics, presenting a 2-Dimensional Fluid Dynamics PDE Solver in the form of a visual simulation.
// The learning objectives associated with this project inciude strengthening familiarity with solving differential equations using computationally efficient methods, using C++ for complex mathematical modelling, and gain a stronger understanding of the modelling process.

// ASSUMPTIONS
// Fluid is incompressible
// Fluid is inviscid (zero viscosity)
// 

// First step, define the equations/methods required.
// GRIDbased method

// Velocity as 2d vector v = [u v]^T
